## Overview

**Pump Fun Sniping Bot** is packaged as a desktop application (Windows and macOS) intended to assist users in spotting short-term token opportunities, simulating execution outcomes, and managing trade lifecycles under conservative safety defaults. The project is presented as a tool for responsible research, education, and operational support ‚Äî not as a tool to automate or deploy manipulative trading behaviour.

This repository contains high-level documentation, configuration templates, scenario simulators, and operator guidance. It is suitable for traders who want a configurable assistant that produces execution proposals, supports backtesting, and enforces strict pre-execution checks.

**Important:** Never paste private keys into untrusted software. Prefer external signing (hardware wallet, wallet provider, remote signer). Use testnets and ephemeral accounts for validation. This project does not promote or provide instructions for illegal or unethical strategies.

## Core capabilities

- **Live market observation** ‚Äî aggregate price, volume, and liquidity metrics from multiple Solana RPCs and market feeds.
- **Opportunity scoring** ‚Äî multi-factor candidate scoring (volume spikes, price momentum, spread analysis, token metadata). Scores are designed for research and operator review.
- **Execution recommendations** ‚Äî non-binding order suggestions that include estimated slippage, fee projection, and confidence level.
- **Position lifecycle tools** ‚Äî configurable rules for entry, take-profit, stop-loss, trailing stops, and scheduled rebalances.
- **Paper trading & simulation** ‚Äî full simulated runs with historic or delayed live feeds to evaluate behavior without real funds.
- **Backtesting suite** ‚Äî replay historical sequences against configurable slippage and fee models to produce performance summaries and risk metrics.
- **Secure signing guidance** ‚Äî recommended patterns for signing (hardware wallets, external wallet sessions, remote signer APIs); no hard-coded keys are required or recommended.
- **Audit trail & reconciliation** ‚Äî immutable logs of signals, operator approvals, and transaction receipts for compliance and post-mortem analysis.
- **Alerting & integrations** ‚Äî webhook, email, and desktop alert integrations to notify operators of key events or safety breaches.
- **Operator controls** ‚Äî manual approval workflows, emergency stop, and escalation paths for critical operations.
- **Extensible connectors** ‚Äî adapter framework for adding new data feeds, exchanges, or AMMs without modifying core logic.
- **Config-driven design** ‚Äî all strategy and safety parameters live in versioned configuration files (secrets are excluded).

## How the application is intended to be used

1. **Collect data**: the app gathers market telemetry (prices, volumes, pool reserves, program logs) from configured providers.  
2. **Compute signals**: analysis modules evaluate recent market behavior and emit a ranked list of candidate opportunities.  
3. **Risk screening**: every candidate passes through safety gates (slippage bounds, fee budgets, token vetting).  
4. **Operator review**: recommendations are presented to the operator with clear metrics; the operator chooses to act or ignore.  
5. **Secure signing**: when execution is approved, the app delegates signing to an external signer (hardware wallet or remote signer with human approval).  
6. **Monitor & log**: execution is monitored and receipts plus contextual metadata are archived for audit and analysis.  
7. **Simulate & refine**: operators run backtests and paper simulations to refine parameters and reduce false positives.

The system separates ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù from ‚Äúsigning‚Äù to minimize exposure of credentials and to ensure human oversight of critical actions.

## Safety and ethical guidelines

- **No private keys in the UI**: the app supports remote signing and hardware wallets only. Users must not paste or upload private keys.  
- **Paper-first workflow**: always validate strategies in simulation or paper trading before enabling live actions.  
- **Conservative defaults**: the shipped configs favor small allocations, tight slippage caps, and manual approval for high-value operations.  
- **Compliance-aware operations**: maintain logs, consult legal counsel regarding local regulations, and respect exchange/platform terms.  
- **No facilitation of abuse**: this README explicitly discourages any manipulative or illegal trading practices. Contributions that enable abuse will be rejected.

## Risk disclosure

Trading fast-moving tokens involves elevated risk, including but not limited to:

- rapid price reversals and volatility,
- illiquidity and wide spreads,
- smart contract or token contract vulnerabilities,
- potential regulatory or policy constraints,
- operational errors or software misconfigurations.

There are no guaranteed profits. Use this tooling for research and informed decision-making only.
